# Maule Player
Media AUdio Library Experience Player

EN / FR documentation in `docs` folder

## Why this project?
I have multiple audio files on a computer/server,
and I want to play them with other connected devices,
ideally with a bit a management part
(search, browse artist/album, playlists, ...).

Some native apps on said devices can do this
but with ads and not-exactly-what-I-want features...
Outrageous! So I decided to start this side-project
that should not be so complex.
It could also be used as demo for a
Symfony/VueJS Progressive Web App
(for development and for showcase).

## How will it work?
This application should be deployed on said
computer/server.
We could link any media directory to load it in
application, that will use associated MP3 metatags.
Any devices connected on same network (cloud or local)
could access to application.
We do not manage users as this application
aimed to be quite 'private'.

## Can I try it?
Yes, feel free to use
[demo site](https://maule.demo.keiwen.fr).
Note that due to music rights,
this site will only provide a single artist.
