# Playlist

## Track list
![Playlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Keiwen/maule_player/main/docs/img/playlist.png)

On this page you will see the list of tracks
that are queued in your current playlist.
Current track is highlighted in the list.

For each track, you can see:
* a button to access the track page
* the track name
* the index of the track in your playlist,
along with the artist name
* a button to play this track

On the top of the content part, you also have the
total duration of the current playlist,
as well as the loop flag.

## Playlist actions

On the top right of the content part, you can access
to playlist actions, where you can:
* activate or deactivate loop
(when activated, the player will start over with
first track when the last is ended)
* shuffle playlist (all tracks are shuffled to a new
random order)
* empty playlist (all tracks are removed from
current playlist)

## Reordering

Each track in the playlist can be re-ordered.
Grab the track by clicking on the text,
keeping mouse click pressed, and move it among
the other tracks. Release mouse click to validate
the new track position.
When a track is grabbed, a red zone appears on the
bottom of your screen. Move the track in this zone
to remove it from the playlist.
